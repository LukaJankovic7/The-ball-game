# The-ball-game
This game was created as a project for one of my courses during my bachelor studies. Game runs on a PIC18F87K22 microcontroller with an addition of MPU_9DOF accelerometer click board for gyroscopic readings. 

The game requires the player to balance the ball and get it across the net without the ball getting stuck, or hitting the wall. The ball bounces 
from the walls of the starting area simulating realistic behaviour. The player has complete controll over the ball controlling it by tilting the board until the 
ball hits the net. After that, the ball starts slowing down until it stops completely. If the ball stops on the other side of the net, without hitting the wall, the 
level is complete, otherwise, the level is reset. Every completed level awards 1 point, and the user has the ability to skip any level without gaining any points.
